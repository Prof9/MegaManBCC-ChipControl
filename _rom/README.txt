INTRODUCTION

Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge is a game featuring notoriously RNG-heavy,
automated gameplay. During battle, the game will choose your chips for you
completely at random, leaving you with very little control over the outcome of
the battle.

Essentially, you have to set up your Program Deck in such a way that it's likely
to beat the opponent, and then just pray to RNGesus that your Navi doesn't
select the same path of dead chips each turn.

This mod changes the battle system to add a Custom Screen-like interface during
battle, similar to the mainline Mega Man Battle Network games. You can view your
chip info and freely choose which chips to use the next turn, resulting in more
deliberate gameplay with moment-to-moment decision-making.



FEATURES

 *  During battle, you can now freely choose which chips to use each turn.
 *  While choosing chips, a preview window is shown detailing the highlighted
    chip's properties and remaining HP. You can press Select to hide/show the
    preview window.
 *  While choosing chips, you can press the L / R Buttons to view the detailed
    description of the highlighted chip.
 *  To balance the difficulty somewhat, the AI is now more likely to avoid
    choosing empty chip slots.
 *  Fully compatible with multiplayer NetBattles! (Both players must be using
    the Chip Control mod.)
 *  Fixes the effects of PanlGrab, AreaGrab, Wind and Fan BattleChips so that
    they now work according to their descriptions.
 *  Supports all versions of the game (North America, Europe, Japan).

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

 Q: Does this mod support multiplayer NetBattles?
 A: Yes! Both players must be using the Chip Control mod.

 Q: Can I still perform the "change plans" action during battle?
 A: Yes. After both players have chosen their chips, but before the Program Deck
    is closed, you can press the L + R Buttons to change plans. This works just
    like in the base game.

 Q: Can I import/export my save file from/to the base game?
 A: Yes, save files are fully cross-compatible with the vanilla game. However,
    emulator save states may cause problems.
